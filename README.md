# Titanic Dataset Statistical Analysis
This project aims to perform a statistical analysis on the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographic information and survival status. We will conduct various statistical analyses to explore relationships, test hypotheses, and gain insights from the data.

# Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this project is a well-known dataset in the field of data analysis and machine learning. It consists of the following variables:

Survived: Indicates whether a passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female)
Age: Age of the passenger in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Fare: Passenger fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
# Analysis
In this project, we will perform the following statistical analyses on the Titanic dataset:

Hypothesis Testing: We will conduct hypothesis tests to explore relationships between variables and evaluate statistical significance. For example, we can test whether the survival rates differ based on passenger class or gender.

Correlation: We will analyze the correlation between variables to identify any potential associations. This will help us understand the relationships between different features of the dataset.

Regression: We will perform regression analysis to predict or estimate the values of a dependent variable (e.g., survival status) based on independent variables (e.g., age, fare, etc.). This will allow us to understand the impact of various factors on the outcome.

Optional Analyses: In addition to the compulsory analyses, we will also conduct one optional analyses among goodness of fit test, chi-square test of independence, or ANOVA, to gain further insights from the data.

# Tools and Libraries Used
The statistical analysis in this project was performed using R programming language and various libraries.
# Conclusion
The statistical analysis on the Titanic dataset provides insights into various factors that influenced survival rates among passengers. By conducting the specified tests, we can better understand the relationships between different variables and make data-driven conclusions.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and apply different statistical techniques to gain further insights from the Titanic dataset.
